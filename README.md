A responsive scaffold project.

## Description

This scaffold uses the [WURFL.js](http://wurfl.io/) device detection script to only load certain elements and dependencies though [yepnope.js](http://yepnopejs.com/) as they are required.

For example, a social media widget is only loaded on larger screens. To cut down on loading additional elements that might normally be hidden, the social media widget is not loaded onto mobile devices.

This project is experimental and can be used as an alternative to static conditional include methods. However, use with caution and test properly for performance. Older methods of selective loading may be better for some projects.

## Dependencies

This scaffold is built with the [http://yeoman.io/](Yeoman) Web App scaffold and includes the following:

- jQuery
- Modernizr
- Yepnope
- Respond.js
- WURFL
- HTML5 Boilerplate
- Girder

### Optional Dependencies

- Bootstrap (Sass Official)
- Font Awesome
- jQuery.mmenu
