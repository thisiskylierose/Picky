A responsive scaffold project.

This scaffold uses the [WURFL.js](http://wurfl.io/) device detection script to only load certain elements as they are required.

For instance, if older versions of IE are also required to support responsive layouts, then [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) is loaded.

Another example is excluding a social media widgets from mobile devices and including them on larger screens.

This is experimental so use with caution. Older methods of selective loading may be better for some projects.
