A responsive scaffold project.

## Description

This scaffold uses the [WURFL.js](http://wurfl.io/) device detection script to only load certain elements as they are required. For example, a social media widget is only loaded on larger screens. This project is experimental and can be used as an alternative to static conditional include methods. However, use with caution and test properly for performance. Older methods of selective loading may be better for some projects.

- jQuery
- Modernizr
- Yepnope
- Respond.js
