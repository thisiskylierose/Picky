A responsive scaffold project.

## Description

This scaffold uses the [WURFL.js](http://wurfl.io/) device detection script to only load certain elements as they are required. For instance, if older versions of IE are also required to support responsive layouts, then [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) is loaded. Another example is excluding a social media widgets from mobile devices and including them on larger screens. This project is experimental so use with caution. Older methods of selective loading may be better for some projects.

- jQuery
- Modernizr
- Yepnope
- Respond.js
